# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder when you define a function to let the function know what type of input it is receiving. An argument is the actual value being used in the parameter when you do a function call.

Researched answer:

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: Value, index, and array.  The value is required and the other two are optional

Researched answer: The value parameter contains the value of the current element of the array. Using map implements an action to each value of the array, so the value parameter is required.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: map gives an output of an array with the same length and filter gives an output of selective elements inside the array 

Researched answer: Both are higher order functions used to manipulate arrays. Using map mutates each element in the array and outputs an array of the new elements. In a filter, a callback function is used for each element with a result being true or false.  Only true elements are returned in the output.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration does something over and over until a specified result is met

Researched answer: Iteration involves using loops to execute a block of code multiple times, either until a certain condition is met or for a specified number of iterations

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: a function takes in parameters and tells it to return a result. Methods are behaviors that are applied to objects.

Researched answer: => are not used with methods

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Though I am not familiar with hoisting in Javascript, just the word itself tells me that it would involve moving something higher. Possibly moving code to a higher position.

Researched answer: Regardless of where variables and functions are declared in the code, they are moved to the top of their scope, which allows them to be used before they are declared in the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Component: Returns data to the user interface through JSX.

2. Spread operator: Allows us to expand or spread out an iterable such as an array or an object into individual elements.

3. React state: Built-in feature of React that allows you to store and manage component-level data that can change over time.

4. React props: Properties that provide a way for components to communicate with each other, share information and control the behavior of child components.

5. DOM events: Actions or occurrences that happen in the Document Object Model (DOM). Examples include clicking a button, typing a key on the keyboard, scrolling the page, and resizing the window.
